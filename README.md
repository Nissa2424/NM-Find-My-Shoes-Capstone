## About the Project
This is my capstone which allows me to display some of the skills I have mastered during my Front-End journey at NSS Bootcamp. This capstone includes the requirements gathering, planning, designing, coding, and documentation stages of the software development lifecycle

## Features

- To quickly take inventory & display all of the shoes in my closet
- This App Demonstrates:
  - Adding Shoes (MVP)
  - Updating Shoe details (MVP)
  - Deleting Shoes (MVP)
Background: Itâ€™s important to know what I have in my closet. I have a bad habit of purchasing the same shoe over and over and over. I can also sell my gently used or new shoes to a consignment store(s) and buy new shoes with the money I make off the sale
